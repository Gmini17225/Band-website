            <h2>About the Festival</h2>
            <p>
                The Comox Valley Band &amp; Choir Festival is a non-competitive educational event
                that brings together middle and secondary school ensembles from across the region.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over three days, students perform in professional venues, receive feedback from
                experienced adjudicators, and connect with other young musicians who share their
                love of music.
            </p>

            <h2>Welcome to the Festival</h2>
            <p>
                Whether this is your first time attending or you return every year, we're
                glad you're here. The festival is designed to be a supportive space where
                students can take musical risks, directors can try new ideas, and families can
                celebrate student achievement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Performances are open to families and community members. We encourage you to
                applaud generously, listen respectfully, and enjoy the variety of ensembles
                that take the stage.
            </p>
